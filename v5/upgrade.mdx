## Dependency Upgrades

Nova's upstream dependencies have been upgraded. You will find a complete list of our dependency upgrades below:

#### Server

* PHP 8.1+
* Laravel Framework 10.34+ and 11.0+
* Inertia Laravel 1.3+ and 2.0+
* Replaced `laravel/ui` with `laravel/fortify` v1.21+
* Removed `doctrine/dbal`

#### Client

* Update to `@inertiajs/vue3` v2
* Update to Heroicons v2
* Update to `trix` v2
* Remove deprecated `form-backend-validation`
* Remove deprecated `places.js`

### Updating Composer Dependencies

You should update your `laravel/nova` dependency to `^5.0` in your application's `composer.json` file:

```diff composer.json
    "require": {
-       "laravel/nova": "^4.0",
+       "laravel/nova": "^5.0",
    }
```

Next, install your updated Composer dependencies:

```shell
composer update mirrors

composer update
```

### Updating Assets and Translations

Next, you should update your application's Nova assets and translation files. To get started, you may run the following commands to update your assets and translations.

**You may wish to store a copy of your current translation file before running this command so you can easily port any custom translations back into the new file after running these commands.**:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nova-assets --force
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nova-lang --force
```

### Updating Third-Party Nova Packages â€‹

If your application relies on Nova tools or packages developed by third-parties, it is possible that these packages are not yet compatible with Nova 5.0 and will require an update from their maintainers.

## Upgrading Authentication Features

Next, you will need to update your Nova configuration file. Ensure that the `api_middleware` configuration option within your application's `nova` configuration file appears as follows:

```php config/nova.php {6,16}
use Laravel\Nova\Actions\ActionResource;
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Middleware\Authenticate;
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Middleware\Authorize;
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Middleware\BootTools;
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Middleware\DispatchServingNovaEvent;
// use Laravel\Nova\Http\Middleware\EnsureEmailIsVerified;
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Middleware\HandleInertiaRequests;

return [

    // ...

    'api_middleware' => [
        'nova',
        Authenticate::class,
        // EnsureEmailIsVerified::class,
        Authorize::class,
    ],

];
```

Next, you need to update `register()` method in `App\Providers\NovaServiceProvider` class and add `parent::register();` before any other codes:

```php app/Nova/NovaServiceProvider.php {6}
/**
 * Register any application services.
 */
public function register(): void 
{
    parent::register();

    //
}
```

## Updating Nova Components (Custom Tool, Cards, Fields, Filters)

### Inertia 2 Compatibility

In Nova 5, Nova's frontend JavaScript now utilizes Inertia.js 2.x, which will affect any projects that directly import from `@inertiajs/inertia` or `@inertiajs/inertia-vue3`. You should inspect your custom components and packages to ensure all references have been updated as suggested in [Inertia's upgrade guide](https://inertiajs.com/upgrade-guide).

```diff
<script>
-import { usePage } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3'
-import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'
+import { router as Inertia, usePage } from '@inertiajs/vue3'

// ...

</script>
```

### Replacing `form-backend-validation`

The `form-backend-validation` repository has been archived and should no longer be used by third-party packages or components. Instead, you may simply import `Errors` from `laravel-nova`:

```diff
<script>
-import { Errors } from 'form-backend-validation'
+import { Errors } from 'laravel-nova'

// ...

</script>
```

Then, you may remove `form-backend-validation` from your component's `package.json`:

```shell
npm remove form-backend-validation
```

## Medium Impact Changes

### Form Abandonment (Using Browser Navigation)

With the introduction of Inertia.js 2.x, we are no longer able to provide form abandonment warnings when using the browser's back button.

### Algolia Place Field Removed

Algolia [retired their "Places" API](https://www.algolia.com/blog/product/sunsetting-our-places-feature/) on May 31, 2022; therefore, the `Place` field was deprecated on Nova 4 and is now removed in Nova 5.

## Low Impact Changes

### Update Published Stubs

Due to various changes in Nova 5.x, you should re-publish the Nova "stubs" if you have previously published them. You can accomplish this by executing the `nova:stubs` Artisan command with the `--force` option:

```shell
php artisan nova:stubs --force
```
