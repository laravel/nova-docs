Once you have defined a filter, you are ready to attach it to a resource. Each resource generated by Nova contains a `filters` method. To attach a filter to a resource, you should simply add it to the array of filters returned by this method:

<CodeGroup>
```php Construct
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Requests\NovaRequest;

public function filters(NovaRequest $request): array
{
    return [
        new Filters\UserType,
    ];
}
```

```php Make
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Requests\NovaRequest;

public function filters(NovaRequest $request): array
{
    return [
        Filters\UserType::make(),
    ];
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Searchable Select Filter

Nova also allows to Select Filter to utilise searchable, you may use the **searchable** method on your filter:

```diff
return [
-   Filters\UserType::make(),
+   Filters\UserType::make()->searchable(),
];
```
