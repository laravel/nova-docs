Nova 5 continues the improvements made in Nova 4.x by modernising various dependencies including Laravel Framework 10 which offers Laravel Prompts, Console Component Views.

In addition, Nova 5 introduces support for Two-Factor Authentication, Password Confirmation, E-mail Verification for new users, Tab Panel, Searchable Search Filter, Dependent Fields improvements, 3rd Party Component improvements, and many more.

## Modernising Dependencies

Nova 5 finally remove support for Laravel Framework 8 and 9 and at the same time bump PHP version to 8.1 and above. This offer wider support for integration with Laravel Ecosystem including Laravel Fortify, Laravel Prompts, Laravel Pennant etc.

Furthermore, Nova 5 frontend code has been updated to utilise Vue v3.5, Heroicons v2 and Inertia.js v2. Please refer to [Upgrade Guide](./upgrade#dependency-upgrades) for full changes.

## Authentication Enhancements

Nova 5 replaced Laravel UI with Laravel Fortify for Authentication and enables Two-Factor Authentication, Password Confirmation and E-mail Verification for new User with little to no code. Similar to Laravel Jetstream, to enable Two-Factor Authentication or E-mail Confirmation you just need to edit `NovaServiceProvider` class:

```php app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php {1,13,14}
use Laravel\Fortify\Features;

// ...

/**
 * Register the configurations for Laravel Fortify.
 */
protected function fortify(): void
{
    Nova::fortify()
        ->features([
            Features::updatePasswords(),
            Features::emailVerification(),
            Features::twoFactorAuthentication(['confirm' => true, 'confirmPassword' => true]),
        ])
        ->register();
}
```

Further reading is available on the [Authentication &amp; Security](./installation#authentication-and-security) documentation.

## Separate Policy Class for Nova Resource

In previous versions, you are only able to define a share [Policy class](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization) for Laravel application and Nova and this can be hard to maintain when you need to have a complex authorization use-case that might differ on the application and Nova. 

In Nova 5, you can finally create a separate policy class only for Nova Resource using the following command:

```shell
php artisan nova:policy
```

<Frame>
![Create UserPolicy class](/images/make-policy-command.png)
</Frame>

To enable the new policy you need to add the following code:

```php app/Nova/User.php {10}
namespace App\Nova;

class User extends Resource
{
    /**
     * The policy the resource corresponds to.
     *
     * @var class-string
     */
    public static $policy = Policies\UserPolicy::class;
}
```

Further reading is available on the [Authorization](./resources/authorization#using-separate-policy-class-for-nova-resource) documentation.

## New Tabs Panel

Nova 5 further improves Resources UI with the introduction of **Tabs Panel**  on the Detail and Form interfaces.

```php app/Nova/Event.php {4,18-28}
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\HasMany;
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\HasManyThrough;
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Requests\NovaRequest;
use Laravel\Nova\Tabs\Tab;

// ... 

/**
 * Get the fields displayed by the resource.
 *
 * @return array<int, \Laravel\Nova\Fields\Field|\Laravel\Nova\Panel>
 */
public function fields(NovaRequest $request): array
{
    return [
        // ... 

        Tab::group('Details', [
            Tab::make('Purchases', [ /* List of fields */ ]),
            Tab::make('Registrations', [ /* List of fields */ ]),
            Tab::make('Event & Venue', [ /* List of fields */ ]),
        ]),

        Tab::group(attribute: 'Relations', fields: [
            HasMany::make('Orders', 'orders', Order::class),
            HasManyThrough::make('Tickets', 'tickets', Ticket::class),
        ]),
    ];
}
```

As an example, the above code snippet will generate the following tabs:

<Frame>
![Tab Panel](/images/tab-panel.png)
</Frame>

Further reading is available on the [documentation](./resources/panels#tabs).

## Fields & Filters Improvements

### New Dependent Computed Field via `Field::computed()` method

Computed field has been a useful feature in previous Nova to display additional information regarding on each Resource. However, since it doesn't have a unique `$attribute` as an identifier it can't be used as Dependent Field. Nova 5 improves this by adding a new `computed()` method.

```php
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\Boolean;
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\FormData;
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\Text;
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Requests\NovaRequest;

// ... 

Boolean::make('Would you like to leave a comment?', 'comment_boolean')
    ->computed(),

Text::make('Comment')
    ->hidden()
    ->dependsOn('comment_boolean', function (Text $field, NovaRequest $request, FormData $formData) {
        if ($formData->boolean('comment_boolean') === true) {
            $field->show();
        }
    }),
```

Further reading is available on the [documentation](./resources/dependent-fields#dependable-computed-fields).

### New `Field::immutable()` method

While [Readonly Fields](./resources/fields#readonly-fields) disable the field’s corresponding input you may wish to still allows the field value to be submitted with the form. To allows this without using `readonly` you can mark fields as “immutable” by invoking the `immutable` method on the field. You may pass a boolean argument to the `immutable` method to dynamically control whether a field should be “immutable”:

```php
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\Text;

// ...

Text::make('Name')->immutable(),
```

Further reading is available on the [documentation](./resources/fields#immutable-fields).

### Other Improvements

* [Allow to disable cascading Dependent Field sync](./resources/dependent-fields#disable-cascading-dependent-field-sync-event)
* [Using Enums as `Select::options()`](./resources/fields#using-enum-as-options)
* [Searchable Select Filter](./filters/registering-filters#searchable-select-filter)
* JSON Repeater is now displayed on Resource Detail

## Pennant Resource Tool for Nova

With the release of Nova 5, we also build a new first-party Nova Component to allow you to view and configure Pennant directly within Nova's UI.

<Frame>
![Pennant Component](/images/pennant-component.png)
</Frame>

To use the component you need to install the component using the following command:

```shell
composer require "laravel/nova-pennant"
```

Next, you must register the tool within the User Resource.

```php app/Nova/User.php {1,15}
use Laravel\Nova\PennantTool\PennantTool;

// ...

/**
 * Get the fields displayed by the resource.
 */
public function fields(NovaRequest $request): array
{
    return [
        ID::make()->sortable(),

        // ...

        PennantTool::make(),
    ];
}
```

#### Authorization to Modify Feature Values

By default Nova user will not have access to activate or deactive features when user are authorized to see the resource. You need to use `canRun()` method to authorized all or specific users.

```php app/Nova/User.php {8}
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Requests\NovaRequest;
use Laravel\Nova\Nova;
use Laravel\Nova\PennantTool\PennantTool;

// ...

PennantTool::make()
    ->canRun((NovaRequest $request) => Nova::user($request)->admin),
```

#### Password Confirmation

You can also requires user to confirm their password before activating or deactivating a feature by using `requiresConfirmPassword()` method:

```php app/Nova/User.php {6}
use Laravel\Nova\PennantTool\PennantTool;

// ...

PennantTool::make()
    ->requiresConfirmPassword(),
```

#### Rich Feature Values

In order to configure rich values Nova would need to depends on class based feature and utilise `options()` method:

```php app/Features/UserTier.php {7-10}
namespace App\Features;

class UserTier 
{
    public $name = 'user-tier';

    public function options(): array 
    {
       return ['solo', 'pro'];
    }
}
```

## 3rd Party Components Development Improvements

Nova 5 would also like to make 3rd Party Components development a great experiences for open-source 3rd party packages for Nova as well as internal packages specific for each Nova project.

We would like to introduces **Laravel Nova DevTool**, a new helper package for Nova Packages development package to allow you preview and create example application directly within the packages (helps debugging issues) and ensure NPM dependencies tally with Nova's own dependencies.

To use the package you need to install the component using the following command:

```shell
composer require --dev "laravel/nova-devtool"
```

Next, you should include the NPM dependencies for `laravel/nova-devtool` using the following command:

```shell
npm install --save-dev "vendor/laravel/nova-devtool"
```

##### Setup Laravel Nova Workbench

Laravel Nova Devtool can setup a basic Laravel Nova installation using `workbench` directory via [Orchestra Workbench](https://github.com/orchestral/workbench). To start the installation you can run the following command:

```shell
php vendor/bin/testbench workbench:install --devtool
```

Once the installation is completed, you should be able to serve Laravel Nova by running the following command:

```shell
composer run serve
```

#### Automatically logged-in the default user

Instead of manually logging-in the user, you may also change `testbench.yaml` to automatically authenticate the user:

```diff testbench.yaml
workbench:
  start: /nova
+ user: nova@laravel.com
  build:
```

#### Install Axios, Lodash, Tailwind CSS or Vue

To simplify the installation, you can run the following commnad:

```shell
php vendor/bin/testbench nova:devtool install
```

#### Enables Vue DevTool for Laravel Nova

By default, Laravel Nova ship with JavaScript compiled for production without Vue DevTool. In order to enable Vue DevTool, you need to run the following command:

```shell
php vendor/bin/testbench nova:devtool enable-vue-devtool
```

#### Disables Vue DevTool for Laravel Nova

To reverse the above action, you need to run the following command:

```shell
php vendor/bin/testbench nova:devtool disable-vue-devtool
```
