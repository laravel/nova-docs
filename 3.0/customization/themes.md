## Overview

There are times when you'd like the visual style of Nova to match your brand or colors. Nova provides a few ways to customize the look and feel of the admin panel.

Here's a video with a quick overview of how to change the main colors of the Nova admin: [Customizing Laravel Nova's CSS and Logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InK-mRH9z5M&t=85s)

## Generating a Custom Theme

Custom themes may be generated using the `nova:theme` Artisan command. By default, all custom themes will be placed in the `nova-components` directory of your application. When generating a theme using the `nova:theme` command, the theme name you pass to the command should follow the Composer `vendor/package` format. So, if we were building a theme called "Miami Ice", we might run the following command:

```bash
php artisan nova:theme example/miami-ice
```

This command will generate all of the boilerplate needed to generate your theme. In addition, a `ThemeServiceProvider` will be auto-registered with your application. This service provider registers your theme with Nova. You do not need to publish the theme CSS manually, as Nova handles this for you.

In the case that the theme service provider is not automatically registered, you can manually register it inside of `config/app.php` under the `providers` key:

```php
'providers' => [
    //...
    \Example\MiamiIce\ThemeServiceProvider::class,
    //...
],
```

### Theme CSS

When Nova generates your theme, a `resources/css/theme.css` file is generated for you. This file contains your theme's styles. Inside you will find some example values already in place for you to edit:

```css
:root {
  --primary: rgb(254, 1, 129, 1);
  --primary-dark: rgb(209, 0, 105, 1);
  --primary-70: rgba(254, 1, 129, 0.7);
  --primary-50: rgba(254, 1, 129, 0.5);
  --primary-30: rgba(254, 1, 129, 0.3);
  --primary-10: rgba(254, 1, 129, 0.1);
  --logo: #430051;
  --sidebar-icon: #db34de;
}

.bg-grad-sidebar {
  background-image: -webkit-gradient(
    linear,
    left bottom,
    left top,
    from(rgb(254, 1, 129, 1)),
    to(#3c4655)
  );

  background-image: linear-gradient(
    0deg,
    rgb(254, 1, 129, 1),
    rgb(100, 5, 113)
  );
}
```

### Publishing Your Themes

After creating your theme, you need to place the theme's public CSS file in the `public` folder of your application. The easiest way to do this is to use the `vendor:publish` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish
```

After running this command, you will be given a list of publishable assets from the various packages installed in your application. Pick the number corresponding to the theme you just generated.

## Applying Theme for Nova Authentication and Password Reset Routes

By default Nova themes will only be applied on Nova admin panel and not the Authentication and Password Reset Routes. 

If you want the theme to be implemented for those pages the route registration from `App\Providers\NovaServiceProvider` to implements the following:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Laravel\Nova\Http\Middleware\DispatchServingNovaEvent;
use Laravel\Nova\NovaApplicationServiceProvider;

class NovaServiceProvider extends NovaApplicationServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register the Nova routes.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    protected function routes()
    {
        Nova::routes()
                ->withAuthenticationRoutes(['web', DispatchServingNovaEvent::class])
                ->withPasswordResetRoutes(['web', DispatchServingNovaEvent::class])
                ->register();
    }
}
```
