# Registering Actions

[[toc]]

Once you have defined an action, you are ready to attach it to a resource. Each resource generated by Nova contains a `actions` method. To attach an action to a resource, you should simply add it to the array of actions returned by this method:

```php
/**
 * Get the actions available for the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return array
 */
public function actions(Request $request)
{
    return [
        new Actions\EmailAccountProfile
    ];
}
```

Alternatively, you may use the `make` method to instantiate your action: 

```php
/**
 * Get the actions available for the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return array
 */
public function actions(Request $request)
{
    return [
        Actions\EmailAccountProfile::make()
    ];
}
```

Any arguments passed to the `make` method will be passed to the constructor of your action.

## Disabling Action Confirmation

By default, when running an action, a confirmation modal is displayed to the user, allowing them to cancel the pending operation. To disable this (and run the action immediately), you can chain the `withoutConfirmation` method to your action definition:

```php
/**
 * Get the actions available for the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return array
 */
public function actions(Request $request)
{
    return [
        Actions\EmailAccountProfile::make()->withoutConfirmation()
    ];
}
```

## Action Visibility

By default, actions are visible on both the resource index and detail screens. In addition, inline actions are hidden from the table row's actions dropdown by default. You may designate an action's visibility by setting one of the following methods on the action when registering it:

- `onlyOnIndex`
- `exceptOnIndex`
- `showOnIndex`
- `onlyOnDetail`
- `exceptOnDetail`
- `showOnDetail`
- `onlyOnTableRow`
- `exceptOnTableRow`
- `showOnTableRow`

```php
/**
 * Get the actions available for the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return array
 */
public function actions(Request $request)
{
    return [
        (new ConsolidateTransaction())->showOnTableRow()
    ];
}
```

## Authorization

If you would like to only expose a given action to certain users, you may chain the `canSee` method onto your action registration. The `canSee` method accepts a Closure which should return `true` or `false`. The Closure will receive the incoming HTTP request:

```php
use App\User;

/**
 * Get the actions available for the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return array
 */
public function actions(Request $request)
{
    return [
        (new Actions\EmailAccountProfile)->canSee(function ($request) {
            return $request->user()->can(
                'emailAnyAccountProfile', User::class
            );
        }),
    ];
}
```

## Authorizing Actions Per-Resource

Sometimes it is useful to conditionally show an action based on some state in the resource's underlying model. To do this you can retrieve the resource from the request using the `findModelQuery` method found on `NovaRequest`:

```php
/**
 * Get the actions available for the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return array
 */
public function actions(Request $request)
{
    return [
        (new Actions\CancelTrial)->canSee(function ($request) {
            return optional($request->findModelQuery()->first())->isOnTrial();
        }),
    ];
}
```

:::warning
It's important to remember that `Resource` actions are not always resolved using an underlying `Model` instance. Because of this, it's important to check for the existence of the model, instead of assuming one is available.
:::

#### The `canRun` Method

Sometimes a user may be able to "see" that an action exists but only "run" that action against certain resources. You may use the `canRun` method in conjunction with the `canSee` method to have full control over authorization in this scenario. The callback passed to the `canRun` method receives the incoming HTTP request as well as the model the user would like to run the action against:

```php
/**
 * Get the actions available for the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return array
 */
public function actions(Request $request)
{
    return [
        (new Actions\EmailAccountProfile)->canSee(function ($request) {
            return true;
        })->canRun(function ($request, $user) {
            return $request->user()->can('emailAccountProfile', $user);
        }),
    ];
}
```

## Pivot Actions

Typically, actions operate on a resource. However, you may also attach actions to `belongsToMany` fields so that they can operate on pivot / intermediate table records. To accomplish this, you may chain the `actions` method onto your field's definition:

```php
BelongsToMany::make('Roles')
    ->actions(function () {
        return [
            new Actions\MarkAsActive,
        ];
    });
```

Once the action has been attached to the field, you will be able to select the action and execute it from the relationship index on the parent's resource detail screen.
