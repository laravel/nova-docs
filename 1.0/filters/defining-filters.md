# Defining Filters

[[toc]]

Nova filters allow you to scope your Nova index queries with custom conditions. For example, you may wish to define a filter to quickly view "Admin" users within your application:

## Select Filters

The most common type of Nova filter is the "select" filter, which allows the user to select a filter option from a drop-down selection menu. You may generate a select filter using the `nova:filter` Artisan command. By default, Nova will place newly generated filters in the `app/Nova/Filters` directory:

```bash
php artisan nova:filter UserType
```

Each select filter generated by Nova contains two methods: `apply` and `options`. The `apply` method is responsible for modifying the query to achieve the desired filter state, while the `options` method defines the "values" the filter may have. Let's take a look at an example `UserType` filter:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Nova\Filters;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Laravel\Nova\Filters\Filter;

class UserType extends Filter
{
    /**
     * Apply the filter to the given query.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @param  \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder  $query
     * @param  mixed  $value
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder
     */
    public function apply(Request $request, $query, $value)
    {
        return $query->where('type', $value);
    }

    /**
     * Get the filter's available options.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function options(Request $request)
    {
        return [
            'Administrator' => 'admin',
            'Editor' => 'editor',
        ];
    }
}
```

The `options` method should return an array of keys and values. The array's keys will be used as the "human-friendly" text that will be displayed in the Nova UI. The array's values will be passed into the `apply` method as the `$value` argument. This filter defines two possible values: `admin` and `editor`.

As you can see in the example above, you may leverage the incoming `$value` to modify your query. The `apply` method should return the modified query instance.

## Boolean Filters

Nova also supports "boolean" filters, which allows the user to select multiple filter option using a list of check-boxes.

![Boolean Filter](./img/boolean-filter.png)

You may generate a boolean filter using the `nova:filter --boolean` Artisan command. By default, Nova will place newly generated filters in the `app/Nova/Filters` directory:

```bash
php artisan nova:filter UserType --boolean
```

Each boolean filter generated by Nova contains two methods: `apply` and `options`. The `apply` method is responsible for modifying the query to achieve the desired filter state, while the options method defines the "values" the filter may have.

When building boolean filters, the `$value` argument passed to the `apply` method is an associative array containing the boolean value of each of your filter's options.

Let's take a look at an example `UserType` filter:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Nova\Filters;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Laravel\Nova\Filters\BooleanFilter;

class UserType extends BooleanFilter
{
    /**
     * Apply the filter to the given query.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @param  \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder  $query
     * @param  mixed  $value
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder
     */
    public function apply(Request $request, $query, $value)
    {
        // dump($value);
        // ['admin' => true/false, 'editor' => true/false]

        return $query->where('is_admin', $value['admin'])
                     ->where('is_editor', $value['editor']);
    }

    /**
     * Get the filter's available options.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @return array
     */
    public function options(Request $request)
    {
        return [
            'Administrator' => 'admin',
            'Editor' => 'editor',
        ];
    }
}
```

The `options` method should return an array of keys and values. The array's keys will be used as the "human-friendly" text that will be displayed in the Nova UI. The array's values will be passed into the `apply` method as the `$value` argument. This filter defines two possible values: `admin` and `editor`.

As you can see in the example above, you may leverage the incoming `$value` to modify your query. The `apply` method should return the modified query instance.

## Date Filters

Nova also supports "date" filters, which allows the user to select the filter's value via a date selection calendar.

![Date Filter](./img/date-filter.png)

You may generate a date filter using the `nova:filter --date` Artisan command. By default, Nova will place newly generated filters in the `app/Nova/Filters` directory:

```bash
php artisan nova:filter BirthdayFilter --date
```

Each date filter generated by Nova contains one method: `apply`. The `apply` method is responsible for modifying the query to achieve the desired filter state.

When building date filters, the `$value` argument passed to the `apply` method is the string representation of the selected date.

Let's take a look at an example `BirthdayFilter` filter:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Nova\Filters;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Carbon;
use Laravel\Nova\Filters\DateFilter;

class BirthdayFilter extends DateFilter
{
    /**
     * Apply the filter to the given query.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @param  \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder  $query
     * @param  mixed  $value
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder
     */
    public function apply(Request $request, $query, $value)
    {
        return $query->where('birthday', '<=', Carbon::parse($value));
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, you may leverage the incoming `$value` to modify your query. The `apply` method should return the modified query instance.

## Filter Titles

If you would like to change the filter title that is displayed in Nova's filter selection menu, you may define a `name` property on the filter class:

    /**
     * The displayable name of the filter.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public $name = 'Filter Title';
