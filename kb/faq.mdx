## Is there a trial or online demo version of Nova? Can I use Nova without a license?

Nova does not currently offer a free trial period. However, we provide a demo installation of Nova for you to explore. In addition, the Nova documentation will assist you in understanding how Nova works and if it's the right fit for your project.

<Note>
    All license purchases are also covered by a limited 15-day refund policy.

## What is a considered a "project"?

A project is a single installed instance of Nova. You may use Nova on local, sandbox/staging servers as well as one production environment. You may use Nova on multiple subdomains as long as they're served from the same instance of Nova. You may not use a single Nova license for multi-tenant websites where there's multiple copies of Nova running. Each of those are considered separate projects and require their own license.

## Can I ship a copy of Nova in my own product?

Nova is not intended to be bundled with any other product or service. However, the code you write for Nova (custom resource tools, metrics and cards, etc) are completely yours to do with what you like. That means you may charge for your Nova packages or any "pre-packaged" Nova resource, etc.

## Can I use an unlimited license for all of my client projects?
Not exactly. An unlimited license provides you unlimited access to Nova for all of your projects, but it doesn't mean your client is also allowed to use your license. Your clients will need their own license to use Nova for their projects.

## Can I get a discount when purchasing multiple licenses at once? Do you have any bulk pricing options?

If you'd like to find out more about bulk licensing please contact us at Nova Support.
