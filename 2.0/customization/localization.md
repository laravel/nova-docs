# Localization

[[toc]]

### Overview

Nova may be fully localized using Laravel's [localization services](https://laravel.com/docs/localization). After running the `nova:install` command during installation. Your application will contain a `resources/lang/vendor/nova` translation directory.

Within this directory, you may customize the `en.json` file or create a new JSON translation file for your language. In addition, the `en` directory contains a few additional validation translation lines that are utilized by Nova.

### Resources

Resource names may be localized by overriding the `label` and `singularLabel` methods on the resource class:

```php
/**
 * Get the displayable label of the resource.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public static function label()
{
    return __('Posts');
}

/**
 * Get the displayable singular label of the resource.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public static function singularLabel()
{
    return __('Post');
}
```

### Fields

Field names may be localized when you attach the field to your resource. The first argument to all fields is its display name, which you may customize. For example, you might localize the title of an email address field like so:

```php
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\Text;

Text::make(__('Email Address'), 'email_address')
```

### Relationships

Relationship field names may be customized by localizing the first argument passed to their field definition. The second and third arguments to Nova relationship fields are the relationship method name and the related Nova resource, respectively:

```php
use App\Nova\Post;
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\HasMany;

HasMany::make(__('Posts'), 'posts', Post::class)
```

In addition, you should also override the `label` and `singularLabel` methods on the resource:

```php
/**
 * Get the displayable label of the resource.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public static function label()
{
    return __('Posts');
}

/**
 * Get the displayable singular label of the resource.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public static function singularLabel()
{
    return __('Post');
}
```

### Filters

Filter names may be localized by overriding the `name` method on the filter class:

```php
/**
 * Get the displayable name of the filter.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public function name()
{
    return __('Admin Users');
}
```

### Lenses

Lens names may be localized by overriding the `name` method on the lens class:

```php
/**
 * Get the displayable name of the lens.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public function name()
{
    return __('Most Valuable Users');
}
```

### Actions

Action names may be localized by overriding the `name` method on the action class:

```php
/**
 * Get the displayable name of the action.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public function name()
{
    return __('Email Account Profile');
}
```

### Metrics

Metric names may be localized by overriding the `name` method on the metric class:

```php
/**
 * Get the displayable name of the metric.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public function name()
{
    return __('Total Users');
}
```

### Frontend

To propagate your localizations to the frontend, you should call the `Nova::translations`method within your `NovaServiceProvider`:

```php
Nova::translations($pathToFile);
```

You may also pass an array of key / value pairs representing each localization:

```php
Nova::translations([
    'Total Users' => 'Total Users'
]);
```

As in Laravel, you may use the `__` helper within your custom Vue components to access these translations.
